\chapter[Sprint V]{Study and Implementation of Sprint V: Community Interaction \& Profile Management}

\section{Introduction}

Sprint V focuses on building a vibrant community ecosystem and profile management capabilities. This sprint introduces community interaction features enabling users to engage through comments, likes, and collaborative copying mechanisms, alongside robust profile management functionality for showcasing work effectively.

The community features transform the platform from a diagramming tool into a collaborative workspace where users discover, learn from, and build upon each other's work.
